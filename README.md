# Angular Component Library

This project is to showcase the angular form <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200" /> components that I built. These components were ideas from work.
I wish to publish them in the future.

## To run the codebase locally

Git clone the project.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
